# @pnpm/fs.v8-file

> Reading/writing binary files serialized with v8

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@pnpm/fs.v8-file)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pnpm/fs.v8-file)

Reading and deserializing a binary file generated with v8.serialize appears to be about 23% faster than reading and parsing a JSON file. Other operations are similar in speed. Therefore, we use V8 binary files instead of JSON files to store data in pnpm’s global store and cache. The disadvantage of this approach is that V8 files generated by newer versions of Node.js cannot be deserialized by older versions.
