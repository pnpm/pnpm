# @pnpm/fs.v8-file

> Reading/writing binary files serialized with v8

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@pnpm/fs.v8-file)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pnpm/fs.v8-file)

V8 serialization and deserialization are much faster than JSON stringification and parsing. Therefore, we use V8 binary files instead of JSON files to store data in pnpm’s global store and cache. The disadvantage of this approach is that V8 files generated by newer versions of Node.js cannot be deserialized by older versions.

## Installation
