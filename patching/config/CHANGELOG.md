# @pnpm/patching.config

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- cb006df: Add ability to apply patch to all versions:
  If the key of `pnpm.patchedDependencies` is a package name without a version (e.g. `pkg`), pnpm will attempt to apply the patch to all versions of
  the package, failure will be skipped.
  If it is a package name and an exact version (e.g. `pkg@x.y.z`), pnpm will attempt to apply the patch to that exact version only, failure will
  cause pnpm to fail.

  If there's only one version of `pkg` installed, `pnpm patch pkg` and subsequent `pnpm patch-commit $edit_dir` will create an entry named `pkg` in
  `pnpm.patchedDependencies`. And pnpm will attempt to apply this patch to other versions of `pkg` in the future.

  If there's multiple versions of `pkg` installed, `pnpm patch pkg` will ask which version to edit and whether to attempt to apply the patch to all.
  If the user chooses to apply the patch to all, `pnpm patch-commit $edit_dir` would create a `pkg` entry in `pnpm.patchedDependencies`.
  If the user chooses not to apply the patch to all, `pnpm patch-commit $edit_dir` would create a `pkg@x.y.z` entry in `pnpm.patchedDependencies` with
  `x.y.z` being the version the user chose to edit.

  If the user runs `pnpm patch pkg@x.y.z` with `x.y.z` being the exact version of `pkg` that has been installed, `pnpm patch-commit $edit_dir` will always
  create a `pkg@x.y.z` entry in `pnpm.patchedDependencies`.
