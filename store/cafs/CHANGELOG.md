## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- d433cb9: Some registries allow identical content to be published under different package names or versions. To accommodate this, index files in the store are now stored using both the content hash and package identifier.

  This approach ensures that we can:

  1. Validate that the integrity in the lockfile corresponds to the correct package,
     which might not be the case after a poorly resolved Git conflict.
  2. Allow the same content to be referenced by different packages or different versions of the same package.

  Related issue: [#8204](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8204)

- 099e6af: Changed the structure of the index files in the store to store side effects cache information more efficiently. In the new version, side effects do not list all the files of the package but just the differences [#8636](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8636).

### Patch Changes

- @pnpm/fetcher-base@16.0.7
- @pnpm/store-controller-types@18.1.6

## 4.0.2

### Patch Changes

- a1f4df2: Fixed a race condition in temporary file creation in the store by including worker thread ID in filename. Previously, multiple worker threads could attempt to use the same temporary file. Temporary files now include both process ID and thread ID for uniqueness [#8703](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8703).

## 4.0.1

### Patch Changes

- db7ff76: When checking whether a file in the store has executable permissions, the new approach checks if at least one of the executable bits (owner, group, and others) is set to 1. Previously, a file was incorrectly considered executable only when all the executable bits were set to 1. This fix ensures that files with any executable permission, regardless of the user class, are now correctly identified as executable [#8546](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8546).

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- db420ab: `getFilePathInCafs` renamed to `getIndexFilePathInCafs`.

## 2.0.1

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 73f2b6826: When several containers use the same store simultaneously, there's a chance that multiple containers may create a temporary file at the same time. In such scenarios, pnpm could fail to rename the temporary file in one of the containers. This issue has been addressed: pnpm will no longer fail if the temporary file is absent but the destination file exists.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- fe1c5f48d: The length of the temporary file names in the content-addressable store reduced in order to prevent `ENAMETOOLONG` errors from happening [#6842](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/6842).

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 4bbf482d1: The package is renamed from `@pnpm/cafs` to `@pnpm/store.cafs`.

  The content-addressable store locker should be only created once per process. This fixes an issue that started happening after merging [#6817](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/6817)
