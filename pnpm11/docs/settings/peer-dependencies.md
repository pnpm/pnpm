### autoInstallPeers

* Default: **true**
* Type: **Boolean**

When `true`, any missing non-optional peer dependencies are automatically installed.

#### Version Conflicts

If there are conflicting version requirements for a peer dependency from different packages, pnpm will not install any version of the conflicting peer dependency automatically. Instead, a warning is printed. For example, if one dependency requires `react@^16.0.0` and another requires `react@^17.0.0`, these requirements conflict, and no automatic installation will occur.

#### Conflict Resolution

In case of a version conflict, you'll need to evaluate which version of the peer dependency to install yourself, or update the dependencies to align their peer dependency requirements.

### dedupePeerDependents

* Default: **true**
* Type: **Boolean**

When this setting is set to `true`, packages with peer dependencies will be deduplicated after peers resolution.

For instance, let's say we have a workspace with two projects and both of them have `webpack` in their dependencies. `webpack` has `esbuild` in its optional peer dependencies, and one of the projects has `esbuild` in its dependencies. In this case, pnpm will link two instances of `webpack` to the `node_modules/.pnpm` directory: one with `esbuild` and another one without it:

```
node_modules
  .pnpm
    webpack@1.0.0_esbuild@1.0.0
    webpack@1.0.0
project1
  node_modules
    webpack -> ../../node_modules/.pnpm/webpack@1.0.0/node_modules/webpack
project2
  node_modules
    webpack -> ../../node_modules/.pnpm/webpack@1.0.0_esbuild@1.0.0/node_modules/webpack
    esbuild
```

This makes sense because `webpack` is used in two projects, and one of the projects doesn't have `esbuild`, so the two projects cannot share the same instance of `webpack`. However, this is not what most developers expect, especially since in a hoisted `node_modules`, there would only be one instance of `webpack`. Therefore, you may now use the `dedupePeerDependents` setting to deduplicate `webpack` when it has no conflicting peer dependencies (explanation at the end). In this case, if we set `dedupePeerDependents` to `true`, both projects will use the same `webpack` instance, which is the one that has `esbuild` resolved:

```
node_modules
  .pnpm
    webpack@1.0.0_esbuild@1.0.0
project1
  node_modules
    webpack -> ../../node_modules/.pnpm/webpack@1.0.0_esbuild@1.0.0/node_modules/webpack
project2
  node_modules
    webpack -> ../../node_modules/.pnpm/webpack@1.0.0_esbuild@1.0.0/node_modules/webpack
    esbuild
```

**What are conflicting peer dependencies?** By conflicting peer dependencies we mean a scenario like the following one:

```
node_modules
  .pnpm
    webpack@1.0.0_react@16.0.0_esbuild@1.0.0
    webpack@1.0.0_react@17.0.0
project1
  node_modules
    webpack -> ../../node_modules/.pnpm/webpack@1.0.0_react@17.0.0/node_modules/webpack
    react (v17)
project2
  node_modules
    webpack -> ../../node_modules/.pnpm/webpack@1.0.0_react@16.0.0_esbuild@1.0.0/node_modules/webpack
    esbuild
    react (v16)
```

In this case, we cannot dedupe `webpack` as `webpack` has `react` in its peer dependencies and `react` is resolved from two different versions in the context of the two projects.

### dedupePeers

Added in: v10.33.0

* Default: **false**
* Type: **Boolean**

When enabled, peer dependency suffixes use version-only identifiers (`name@version`) instead of full dep paths, eliminating nested suffixes like `(foo@1.0.0(bar@2.0.0))`. This dramatically reduces the number of package instances in projects with many recursive peer dependencies.

This is different from [`dedupePeerDependents`](#dedupepeerdependents), which deduplicates packages that have the same peer dependencies across different workspace projects. `dedupePeers` simplifies the peer dependency suffix format itself.

### strictPeerDependencies

* Default: **false**
* Type: **Boolean**

If this is enabled, commands will fail if there is a missing or invalid peer
dependency in the tree.

### resolvePeersFromWorkspaceRoot

* Default: **true**
* Type: **Boolean**

When enabled, dependencies of the root workspace project are used to resolve peer dependencies of any projects in the workspace.
It is a useful feature as you can install your peer dependencies only in the root of the workspace, and you can be sure that all projects in the workspace use the same versions of the peer dependencies.

### peerDependencyRules

#### peerDependencyRules.ignoreMissing

pnpm will not print warnings about missing peer dependencies from this list.

For instance, with the following configuration, pnpm will not print warnings if a dependency needs `react` but `react` is not installed:

```yaml
peerDependencyRules:
  ignoreMissing:
  - react
```

Package name patterns may also be used:

```yaml
peerDependencyRules:
  ignoreMissing:
  - "@babel/*"
  - "@eslint/*"
```

#### peerDependencyRules.allowedVersions

Unmet peer dependency warnings will not be printed for peer dependencies of the specified range.

For instance, if you have some dependencies that need `react@16` but you know that they work fine with `react@17`, then you may use the following configuration:

```yaml
peerDependencyRules:
  allowedVersions:
    react: "17"
```

This will tell pnpm that any dependency that has react in its peer dependencies should allow `react` v17 to be installed.

It is also possible to suppress the warnings only for peer dependencies of specific packages. For instance, with the following configuration `react` v17 will be only allowed when it is in the peer dependencies of the `button` v2 package or in the dependencies of any `card` package:

```yaml
peerDependencyRules:
  allowedVersions:
    "button@2>react": "17",
    "card>react": "17"
```

#### peerDependencyRules.allowAny

`allowAny` is an array of package name patterns, any peer dependency matching the pattern will be resolved from any version, regardless of the range specified in `peerDependencies`. For instance:

```yaml
peerDependencyRules:
  allowAny:
  - "@babel/*"
  - "eslint"
```

The above setting will mute any warnings about peer dependency version mismatches related to `@babel/` packages or `eslint`.
