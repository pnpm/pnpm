`pnpm deploy --prod` and `pnpm deploy --no-optional` no longer list the excluded dependency groups in the deployed `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`. The deployed lockfile referenced packages that the deploy left out of its graph, so installing in the deploy directory afterwards created dangling symlinks [#13623](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/13623).
