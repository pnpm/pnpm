## 0.1.0-alpha.8

### Minor Changes

- Added an opt-in proof of concept that lets installs reuse a dependency's build output across machines, by publishing and restoring signed, organization-scoped artifacts through pnpr instead of running the lifecycle scripts locally.

  Configure it with the new `remoteSideEffectsCache` setting. A workspace names the eligible `organization` and `packages`; everything describing the act of signing — `publish`, `keyId`, `builderId`, `trustedKeys`, `privateKey` and the provenance fields — is refused in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and read from the global config file or the environment instead.

- Hosted pnpr registries now serve newly published original artifacts from registry-scoped SHA-512 digest URLs.

- Allowed `pnpm update --patches` to refresh registry revisions through a configured pnpr server while retaining locked package versions.

- Added explicit registry revision selection with `<version>+rN` and `pnpm update --patches` for refreshing revision artifacts without changing package versions. Registry-backed lockfile policy checks recognize historical revisions, and pnpr now preserves safe revision histories from upstream registries.

- Added support for registry replacement tarballs using standard integrity values, explicit revision fields, registry routing from the `registries` setting, non-redirecting integrity-addressed URLs, canonical safe-integer revision numbers, and pnpr proxying for immutable upstream revision artifacts.

### Patch Changes

- Forward `patchedDependencies` hashes and `packageExtensions` to pnpr so server-side resolution preserves patches and package extensions in the lockfile and installed packages.
