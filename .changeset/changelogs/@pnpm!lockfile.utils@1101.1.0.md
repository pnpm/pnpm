## 1101.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Added a new setting `minimumReleaseAgeExcludePrune`. When enabled, `pnpm add`, `pnpm update`, and `pnpm remove` prune the entries of `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` that the freshly written lockfile no longer resolves: versions that are gone are dropped (an entry is removed once none of its versions remain), and entries for packages that are no longer in the lockfile are removed too. Name patterns (`@scope/*`) are always kept. The cleanup is skipped when the install's lockfile does not cover the whole workspace (`sharedWorkspaceLockfile: false`), since entries another project still needs would look stale.

  Renamed `cleanupUnusedCatalogs` to `catalogPrune`, so that catalog pruning and release-age exclude pruning use one vocabulary. `cleanupUnusedCatalogs` continues to work; when both are set, `catalogPrune` wins.

### Patch Changes

- An `integrity` recorded on a git dependency's resolution (`resolution: {type: git, repo, commit, integrity: sha512-…}`) is no longer treated as a checksum. pnpm never verifies a git checkout against such a hash — the commit pins the content — so it is now dropped when the lockfile is rewritten, and `pnpm sbom` no longer republishes it as a CycloneDX/SPDX checksum. Lockfiles carrying one also load again instead of failing with `ERR_PNPM_BROKEN_LOCKFILE` [#13042](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/13042).

  `pnpm sbom` now also publishes the checksum of a `type: binary` runtime archive, which pnpm does verify.
