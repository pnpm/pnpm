## 1100.0.35

### Patch Changes

- Concurrent installs that import the same package into one project now all complete. One of them used to fail with `ENOTEMPTY` when its copy of the package collided with the copy another install had already placed [pnpm/tasks#48](https://github.com/pnpm/tasks/issues/48).

- A script listed in `syncInjectedDepsAfterScripts` now keeps a package's links to its own files as links in the injected copies, the way `pnpm install` writes them. It no longer fails when the package links to one directory twice or links back to a directory above the link. `pnpm install` with `deployAllFiles` no longer fails on such a link back either.

- Updated dependencies:
  - @pnpm/core-loggers@1101.0.3
  - @pnpm/store.controller-types@1101.3.4
