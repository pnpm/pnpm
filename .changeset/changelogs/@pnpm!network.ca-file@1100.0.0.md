## 1100.0.0

### Patch Changes

- `@pnpm/config.env-replace`, `@pnpm/log.group`, `@pnpm/network.agent`, `@pnpm/network.ca-file`, `@pnpm/network.config`, `@pnpm/network.proxy-agent`, and the `@pnpm/os.env.path-extender` packages are now published from the pnpm repository. They are ES modules.

- `pnpm install` now works in StackBlitz WebContainers on projects without a lockfile. It used to fail there with `ENOENT ... pnpm-lock.yaml`, because pnpm did not recognize the errors that WebContainers return from asynchronous file system calls [#15649](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/15649).

- Updated dependencies:
  - @pnpm/error@1100.2.1
