## 1100.2.12

### Patch Changes

- `pnpm deploy` with a shared lockfile now copies workspace dependencies into the deploy directory, even when `packageImportMethod` is set to `hardlink`. Previously, their files were hard-linked to the workspace sources, so editing a source file also changed the deployed copy [pnpm/pnpm#12176](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/12176).

- `pnpm install` no longer fails for an injected workspace dependency whose package publishes from a `publishConfig.directory` that its own `prepare` script builds. The injected copy now picks up that directory once `prepare` finishes building it. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` no longer reports the dependency as outdated while the directory has not been built yet.
