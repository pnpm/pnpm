## 1100.2.4

### Patch Changes

- Registry revisions are no longer supported. pnpm now fails with `ERR_PNPM_REGISTRY_REVISIONS_UNSUPPORTED` on registry metadata that selects a revision, on a `+rN` version specifier, and on a lockfile entry with a `revision` field. `pnpm update --patches` is removed.

- Updated dependencies:
  - @pnpm/types@1102.1.2
