## 1101.0.5

### Patch Changes

- `pnpm install` now resolves a scope's packages again when the scope is routed to another registry in `registries`. Before, the lockfile kept the versions and integrity resolved from the old registry, so the install failed when the new registry did not serve a locked version or served different content. pnpm records in the workspace state which registry each scope routed to, so a fresh clone without that record installs the lockfile as recorded. Changing the default registry resolves nothing again, and `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` is unchanged.

- Installs delegated to a pnpr server now resolve every prefix declared for a registry URL. A dependency or lockfile entry that used the second of two prefixes for the same registry, such as `zeta:` next to `work:` in `namedRegistries`, failed on the server [pnpm/tasks#204](https://github.com/pnpm/tasks/issues/204).

- Updated dependencies:
  - @pnpm/types@1102.1.3
