## 1101.0.0

### Major Changes

- Workspace install, rebuild, pack, publish, stage, and lifecycle work now starts as soon as its dependencies finish instead of waiting for an unrelated topological group.

### Minor Changes

- Workspace task orchestration ([pnpm/rfcs#23](https://github.com/pnpm/rfcs/pull/23)). `pnpm -r run` and `pnpm -r exec` now schedule per task instead of in topological chunks: a task starts as soon as the tasks it depends on have finished, so a project no longer waits for unrelated projects that happen to share its chunk.

  A new `tasks` section in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` declares what a task depends on, using the `^` convention:

  ```yaml
  tasks:
    build:
      dependsOn: ['^build']
    test:
      dependsOn: ['build']
    lint: {}
  ```

  `^name` means the named task in each of the project's workspace dependencies; a bare `name` means the task in the same project; an entry with no `dependsOn` declares an empty dependency list. A task with no entry behaves as `dependsOn: ['^<its own name>']`, which is exactly what the previous chunked ordering implied — an unconfigured workspace gets the scheduler improvement and nothing else changes meaning. A project without the script is reported skipped and passes its edges through to its own dependencies, so a scriptless package does not sever a chain.

  Also part of this change:

  - A dependency cycle among the tasks of a run is now an error naming the participating tasks (`ERR_PNPM_TASK_CYCLE`) instead of silently running in an arbitrary order. Setting `ignoreWorkspaceCycles: true` downgrades the error to a warning: the cycle's tasks run in an arbitrary order relative to each other.
  - `--resume-from` now skips exactly the transitive dependencies of the anchor package; work unrelated to the anchor still runs.
  - Under `--no-bail`, tasks whose dependencies failed are reported as skipped, not failed, and do not add to the exit code.
  - With `--bail` (the default), the first failure still ends the run at once and nothing new is dispatched — including scripts already queued behind the concurrency limit.
  - `pnpm -r run --dry-run <script>` prints the task graph that would execute without running anything (including skipping the `verifyDepsBeforeRun` check); `--json` emits the tasks and their resolved dependency edges.
  - Output is inherited rather than piped only when at most one script can ever be in flight (`--workspace-concurrency=1`, or the graph forces the scripts to run one after another).
