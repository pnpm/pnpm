## 1101.0.0

### Major Changes

- The three registry lookups are now named for what they are keyed by, so that none of them is called `registries` — a name the `registries` setting itself has taken:

  | before | after |
  |---|---|
  | `Config.registries` | `Config.registriesByScope` |
  | `Config.namedRegistries` | `Config.registriesByPrefix` |
  | `Config.registryOptions` | `Config.registryOptionsByUrl` |

  The same rename applies to the `RegistryContext` fields, the `Registries` and `NamedRegistries` types (now `RegistriesByScope` and `RegistriesByPrefix`), `normalizeRegistries` / `normalizeNamedRegistries` (now `normalizeRegistriesByScope` / `normalizeRegistriesByPrefix`), and the `BUILTIN_NAMED_REGISTRIES` constant (now `BUILTIN_REGISTRIES_BY_PREFIX`).

  This is an internal rename: no setting, error code, lockfile field, or `.pnpmfile.cjs` hook field changes. A `preResolution` hook still reads `ctx.registries`, which is the name pacquet passes as well. The `registries` and `namedRegistries` settings are read under the names users write them.

  The pnpr resolve request sends `registriesByPrefix` where it sent `namedRegistries`. A pnpr server and its clients must be on matching versions, which is already the case for an experimental server.

### Minor Changes

- `pnpm config get` and `pnpm config list` now show the settings pnpm acts on under their documented names:

  - `registries` shows the registries pnpm resolves from, merged across every source (`.npmrc`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, the global config, CLI flags), in the shape the setting is written in: keyed by registry URL, with the default registry declared as the bare `@` scope. Built-in routes are included — the `@jsr` scope and the `npmjs` and `gh` prefixes — unless pointed elsewhere. Previously `pnpm config get registries` printed `undefined`.
  - `update` and `audit` show the effective sections, whichever spelling set them. The deprecated internal spellings (`updateConfig`, `auditConfig`, `auditLevel`) are no longer listed.
  - `catalogs` shows the complete resolved catalog set — the singular `catalog` block is its `default` entry — whichever spelling declared it.
  - The `registry` and `@scope:registry` entries show the merged routes rather than raw `.npmrc` values, so they always agree with the `registries` view.
