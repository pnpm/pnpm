## 1101.3.2

### Patch Changes

- `pnpm install` no longer fails for an injected workspace dependency whose package publishes from a `publishConfig.directory` that its own `prepare` script builds. The injected copy now picks up that directory once `prepare` finishes building it. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` no longer reports the dependency as outdated while the directory has not been built yet. [pnpm/pnpm#7811](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/7811)

- The side-effects cache now restores the symlinks that a build script creates inside a package. A warm install used to replace each of them with a copy of its target [#12859](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/12859).

  After upgrading, every package with a build script is built once more.

- With `resolutionMode: time-based`, a transitive dependency that has no matching version published before the time-based cutoff now resolves to the lowest matching version allowed by `minimumReleaseAge`. pnpm picks a version younger than `minimumReleaseAge` only if no older version matches [#16298](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/16298).

- Updated dependencies:
  - @pnpm/fetching.fetcher-base@1100.2.12
  - @pnpm/resolving.resolver-base@1101.3.2
