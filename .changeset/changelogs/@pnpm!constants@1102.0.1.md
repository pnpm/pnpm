## 1102.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Dependency resolution reads cached registry metadata faster. The metadata cache moved to `<cache-dir>/v12/`, so the first install after upgrading downloads registry metadata again. A damaged cache entry is downloaded again, or reported as an error when `--offline` is set [#13512](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/13512).
