## 1100.1.8

### Patch Changes

- `pnpm install` now repairs a `pnpm-lock.yaml` whose `(patch_hash=<hash>)` dependency paths disagree with its `patchedDependencies` map, including paths that lack the hash their patch calls for. pnpm previously accepted such a lockfile as up to date and kept the old patched files. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` now fails on such a lockfile with `ERR_PNPM_INCONSISTENT_PATCH_HASH`. It fails with `ERR_PNPM_UNCHECKABLE_PATCH_HASH` when a patch hash in the lockfile is malformed, or when the lockfile lacks the package version or patch entry that the check needs [#15336](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/15336).

- Fixed `pnpm rebuild` modifying packages shared with projects that have not approved their build scripts when using the global virtual store.

- Updated dependencies:
  - @pnpm/deps.path@1101.0.5
  - @pnpm/error@1100.2.1
