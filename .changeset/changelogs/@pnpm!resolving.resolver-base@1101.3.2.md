## 1101.3.2

### Patch Changes

- With `resolutionMode: time-based`, a transitive dependency that has no matching version published before the time-based cutoff now resolves to the lowest matching version allowed by `minimumReleaseAge`. pnpm picks a version younger than `minimumReleaseAge` only if no older version matches [#16298](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/16298).
