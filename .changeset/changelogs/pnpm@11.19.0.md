## 11.19.0

### Minor Changes

- `pnpm login` no longer requires an interactive terminal when the registry supports web-based login: without a TTY it prints the authentication URL (skipping the QR code and the "Press ENTER to open the URL in your browser" prompt) and polls the registry until the browser approval completes. Only the classic username/password login still fails with `ERR_PNPM_LOGIN_NON_INTERACTIVE` in a non-interactive terminal.

- The `save-prefix` setting now accepts `=`: newly added dependencies are saved with an explicit `=` operator (`=1.2.3`) instead of the setting being silently treated as the default `^`.

### Patch Changes

- `allowBuilds` entries can now approve git-hosted packages that pnpm downloads as a tarball, such as `github:` dependencies (which are fetched from `codeload.github.com` rather than cloned), by their repository URL without the resolved commit hash. This matches the hashless `git+` matching already supported for cloned git dependencies. For example:

  ```yaml
  allowBuilds:
    "foo@git+https://github.com/org/foo.git": true
  ```

  This approves the package whether pnpm clones it or downloads a tarball, so the entry no longer has to be updated every time the pinned commit changes. GitLab and Bitbucket tarball downloads are matched the same way. Approving or denying a specific resolved commit by its full tarball dep path continues to work.

- `pnpm outdated --include-github-actions` no longer blocks on an interactive git credential prompt when a workflow uses a private action repo.

- Prevented `minimumReleaseAge` from replacing `latest` with a SemVer-greater version than the registry tag target [#13034](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/13034).

- Fixed empty `bundledDependencies` and `bundleDependencies` arrays causing nondeterministic lockfile changes. See pnpm/pnpm#13123.

- The install summary no longer prints `(X is available)` when the registry's `dist-tags.latest` is still held back by the active `minimumReleaseAge` policy. The hint only ever names the actual latest tag, so an immature latest suppresses the hint instead of advertising the version pnpm just refused to install [#11698](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/11698).

- `pnpm update` keeps the explicit `=` operator of an exact version pin: a dependency saved as `=3.5.1` now updates to `=3.5.2` instead of the bare `3.5.2`. See pnpm/pnpm#13168.

- Preserve a workspace dependency's `link:` entry when a run does not target it — e.g. `pnpm update <other-pkg>` (with or without `--recursive`), or a plain install after a root/catalog dependency change — with `injectWorkspacePackages`, instead of spuriously rewriting it to a peer-suffixed `file:` protocol. See pnpm/pnpm#10433.

- Renamed the `PinnedVersion` type to `RangeSpecStyle` and the `pinnedVersion` option fields to `rangeSpecStyle`: the value selects the operator a specifier is saved with, not a pin. `whichVersionIsPinned` is now `inferRangeSpecStyle`, and the new `rangeSpecGranularity` helper collapses the `exact` spelling to its `patch` range width. `@pnpm/types` keeps `PinnedVersion` as a deprecated alias of `RangeSpecStyle`. The rename itself changes no CLI behavior; the `=`-pin handling is described in its own changesets.

- The default reporter no longer depends on `@pnpm/config.reader` at runtime: it declares its own minimal `ReporterPnpmConfig` type for the config fields it reads. Hosts that embed the reporter no longer pull in the config-reader dependency tree.

- Workspace dependencies declared with a relative path (e.g. `"foo": "workspace:../foo"`) are no longer silently dropped from the workspace projects graph, so `--filter` selection and the topological order of recursive commands take them into account.
