## 1101.3.3

### Patch Changes

- Registry revisions are no longer supported. pnpm now fails with `ERR_PNPM_REGISTRY_REVISIONS_UNSUPPORTED` on registry metadata that selects a revision, on a `+rN` version specifier, and on a lockfile entry with a `revision` field. `pnpm update --patches` is removed.

- When `pnpm install` resolves a dependency again, it now reuses a version that the install already resolved for the same package, as a fresh install does. Before, it kept the version the lockfile pinned and added a second copy of the package. A locked version still stays when nothing else in the install prefers another version. To pin a transitive dependency on purpose, use `overrides` [#17084](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/17084).
