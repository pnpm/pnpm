## 1100.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Added explicit registry revision selection with `<version>+rN` and `pnpm update --patches` for refreshing revision artifacts without changing package versions. Registry-backed lockfile policy checks recognize historical revisions, and pnpr now preserves safe revision histories from upstream registries.

- Added support for registry replacement tarballs using standard integrity values, explicit revision fields, registry routing from the `registries` setting, non-redirecting integrity-addressed URLs, canonical safe-integer revision numbers, and pnpr proxying for immutable upstream revision artifacts.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies:
  - @pnpm/types@1102.1.0
