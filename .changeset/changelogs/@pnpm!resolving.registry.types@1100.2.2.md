## 1100.2.2

### Patch Changes

- pnpm no longer revalidates cached registry metadata when the registry sends `Cache-Control: max-age=0`, `no-cache`, or `no-store`. It downloads the metadata again, so a version newly published to such a registry is visible on the next install [#13487](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/13487).
