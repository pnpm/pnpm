`pnpm install` now re-resolves a workspace project's auto-installed peer dependency when another workspace project changes its specifier for that package to one that excludes the locked version but still overlaps the peer range. The peer then resolves to the version a fresh install would pick [#11800](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/11800).
