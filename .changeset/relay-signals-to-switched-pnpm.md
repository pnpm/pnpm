A signal sent to pnpm, such as `SIGTERM`, now reaches the pnpm that pnpm switches to because of `packageManager` or `devEngines.packageManager`, and the one that `pnpm with` runs. The signal used to be dropped, so scripts running under that pnpm never got to shut down [#9948](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9948).
