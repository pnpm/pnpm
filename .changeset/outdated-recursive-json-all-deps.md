`pnpm -r outdated --json` now includes every outdated workspace dependency when multiple projects depend on different versions or dependency types of the same package. Such a package is keyed by its current version and dependency type, for example `vue@2.7.14 (dev)` [#7693](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/7693).
