An injected workspace package that was linked now becomes a copy when the project that depends on it starts providing one of its peers at a version the package's own workspace context lacks. The link used to stay until that dependency was updated, so the package could not find the peer the project provides [#17057](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/17057).
