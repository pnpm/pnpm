A new setting is now supported: `dedupe-peer-dependents`.

When this setting is set to `true`, packages with peer dependencies will be deduplicated after peers resolution.

For instance, let's say we have a workspace with two projects and both of them have `webpack` in their dependencies. `webpack` has `esbuild` in its optional peer dependencies, and one of the projects has `esbuild` in its dependencies. In this case, pnpm will link two instances of `webpack` to the `node_modules/.pnpm` directory: one with `esbuild` and another one without it:

```
node_modules
  .pnpm
    webpack@1.0.0_esbuild@1.0.0
    webpack@1.0.0
project1
  node_modules
    webpack -> ../../node_modules/.pnpm/webpack@1.0.0/node_modules/webpack
project2
  node_modules
    webpack -> ../../node_modules/.pnpm/webpack@1.0.0_esbuild@1.0.0/node_modules/webpack
    esbuild
```

This makes sense because `webpack` is used in two projects, and one of the projects doesn't have `esbuild`, so the two projects cannot share the same instance of `webpack`. However, this is not what most developers expect, especially since in a hoisted `node_modules`, there would only be one instance of `webpack`. Therefore, you may now use the `dedupe-peer-dependents` setting to deduplicate `webpack` when it has no conflicting peer dependencies. In this case, if we set `dedupe-peer-dependents` to `true`, both projects will use the same `webpack` instance, which is the one that has `esbuild` resolved:

```
node_modules
  .pnpm
    webpack@1.0.0_esbuild@1.0.0
project1
  node_modules
    webpack -> ../../node_modules/.pnpm/webpack@1.0.0_esbuild@1.0.0/node_modules/webpack
project2
  node_modules
    webpack -> ../../node_modules/.pnpm/webpack@1.0.0_esbuild@1.0.0/node_modules/webpack
    esbuild
```
