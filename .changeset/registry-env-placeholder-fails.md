A `${VAR}` placeholder in a registry URL in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` or the project `.npmrc` now fails the command. pnpm does not expand environment variables in these files. Before, pnpm ignored such a URL and resolved packages from another registry, such as npmjs.org. pnpm now warns when it ignores a placeholder in a proxy, `pnprServer`, or `userAgent` setting in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` [#17762](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/17762).
