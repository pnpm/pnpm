New option added for: `node-mirror:<releaseDir>`. The string value of this dynamic option is used as the base URL for downloading node when `use-node-version` is specified. The `<releaseDir>` portion of this argument can be any dir in `https://nodejs.org/download`. Which `<releaseDir>` dynamic config option gets selected depends on the value of `use-node-version`. If 'use-node-version' is a simple `x.x.x` version string, `<releaseDir>` becomes `release` and `node-mirror:release` is read. Defaults to `https://nodejs.org/download/<releaseDir>/`.
