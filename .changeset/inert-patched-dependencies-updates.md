Adding, editing, or removing an entry in `patchedDependencies` no longer re-resolves the dependency graph. Resolution never reads a patch — it only records the patch file's hash against the package it matches — so the install now rewrites the affected entries in `pnpm-lock.yaml` and materializes the patched package from the store instead. Installs still fall back to a full resolution when the patched package is reachable as a peer dependency, and when the new configuration would leave a patch unused while `allowUnusedPatches` is off, so `ERR_PNPM_UNUSED_PATCH` is still reported.
