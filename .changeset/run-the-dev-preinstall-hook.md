The root project's `pnpm:devPreinstall` script now runs before resolution and linking, as it does in pnpm 11. It is skipped under `--ignore-scripts`, `--lockfile-only` and `--dry-run`, by `pnpm fetch` and `pnpm rebuild`, and by a repeat install that is already up to date. Workspaces that use the hook to prepare state the install depends on — such as [next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), which generates a placeholder `next` bin with it — were left with dependents linked against files that were never created [#13313](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/13313).
