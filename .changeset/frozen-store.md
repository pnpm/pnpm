Added a new setting `frozenStore` (`--frozen-store`) that lets `pnpm install` run against a package store on a read-only filesystem (e.g. a Nix store, a read-only bind mount, an OCI layer). When enabled, pnpm opens the store's SQLite `index.db` through the `immutable=1` URI — bypassing the WAL/`-shm` sidecar creation that otherwise fails on a read-only directory — and suppresses every store-write path (the `index.db` writer and the project-registry write). Pair it with `--offline --frozen-lockfile` against a fully-populated store. Under the global virtual store, package directories live inside the store, so if the store is missing the build output of a package whose lifecycle scripts are approved (or that has a patch), pnpm fails up front with `ERR_PNPM_FROZEN_STORE_NEEDS_BUILD` rather than crashing mid-build on a read-only write — seed the store with those builds first. Incompatible with `--force` and with a configured pnpr server, since both write into the store; the side-effects cache is likewise not written under `frozenStore`. If the store is missing its content directory, the install fails fast with `ERR_PNPM_FROZEN_STORE_INCOMPLETE` rather than attempting to initialize it. The read-only `immutable=1` open requires Node.js >=22.15.0, >=23.11.0, or >=24.0.0; on older runtimes `--frozen-store` fails with a clear `ERR_PNPM_FROZEN_STORE_UNSUPPORTED_NODE` error. Bin-linking also tolerates a read-only store: under the global virtual store a package's bin source lives inside the store, so the `chmod` that makes it executable would be refused — with `EPERM`/`EACCES`, or with `EROFS` on a genuinely read-only filesystem. That `chmod` is redundant when the seed already ships its bins executable with a normalized shebang, so it is now skipped in that case, while a non-executable bin (or one still carrying a Windows CRLF shebang) on a read-only store still errors.
