Re-fetch full registry metadata when `minimumReleaseAge` is enabled and an abbreviated packument's `time` map omits timestamps for some versions. This prevents mature versions from being filtered out and resolution from falling back to the lowest matching version [pnpm/pnpm#13741](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/13741).
