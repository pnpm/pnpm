Fixed `404` errors when installing from a registry that serves scoped packages only from a percent-encoded path, such as GitHub Enterprise Server. Outside `registry.npmjs.org`, a tarball URL that encodes the scope separator as `%2f` or `%2F` is no longer mistaken for one that pnpm can rebuild from the package name, version, and registry, so it is kept in `pnpm-lock.yaml` and requested verbatim on the next install [#13534](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/13534).
