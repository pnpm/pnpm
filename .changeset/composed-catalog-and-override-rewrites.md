A changed `catalogs` or `pnpm.overrides` block no longer has to be the only change for `pnpm install` to update the lockfile in place. Editing an override while also removing a dependency, or changing a catalog entry in the same commit as a range bump, is now absorbed in one pass instead of re-resolving the whole dependency graph [#13799](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/13799).

Fixed the lockfile an in-place override update wrote when the overridden package was also a catalog entry: the entry kept the version it had before the override moved the package. The same could happen in reverse, when a catalog entry moved a package an override pins. Both cases now re-resolve instead.
