An auto-installed *optional* peer is no longer hoisted at a version the workspace root's own dependency on that package excludes. `resolvePeersFromWorkspaceRoot` already made the workspace root's specifier decide which version a missing *required* peer is installed at; the optional-peer picker ignored it and always took the highest version present anywhere in the graph. In a workspace whose root pins `postcss: 8.5.10`, an importer that depends on `webpack` and declares no `postcss` of its own got `postcss@8.5.22` hoisted for `terser-webpack-plugin`'s optional `postcss` peer, leaving two `postcss@8.5.x` instances in the graph [#13320](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/13320).
