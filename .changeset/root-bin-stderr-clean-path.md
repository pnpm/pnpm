`pnpm root -g` and `pnpm bin -g` now print warnings to stderr instead of stdout, so their stdout stays a clean, machine-readable path. Previously, running either command with `--global` in a project that pins a package manager (e.g. via the `packageManager` field) printed a warning like `[WARN] Using --global skips the package manager check for this project` ahead of the path, breaking programs that capture the output as a path [#13672](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/13672).

In pnpm 12, `pnpm root -g` and `pnpm prefix -g` are now supported (they previously failed with `ERR_PNPM_CLI_ROOT_GLOBAL_UNSUPPORTED` / `ERR_PNPM_CLI_PREFIX_GLOBAL_UNSUPPORTED`), and the reporter output of `dlx`, `create`, `config`, `sbom`, `with`, `store`, `prefix`, `root`, and `bin` goes to stderr, matching pnpm 11.
