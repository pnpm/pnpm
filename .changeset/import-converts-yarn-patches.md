`pnpm import` now converts dependencies that use Yarn's `patch:` protocol. The dependency keeps the version it patches, and the patch file is added to `patchedDependencies` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. If the patch file is missing, pnpm prints a warning and imports the dependency without the patch [#10278](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10278).
