`pnpm update` no longer replaces the specifier a project declares for a dependency that is also listed in `overrides`. A `catalog:` reference stays a `catalog:` reference, and a declared range stays as written, instead of being rewritten to the version the override resolved to [#12115](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/12115).
