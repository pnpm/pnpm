`pnpm update` without saving no longer records a version that the manifest's range excludes. The kept range stays authoritative: a requested version outside it is skipped with a warning, and a requested range, a dist tag, or `--latest` resolves within it instead of past it. Previously each of these could write a lockfile entry that contradicted its own specifier, which the next `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` rejected with `ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE` [#12764](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/12764).
