`pnpm self-update <tag>` no longer downgrades when the dist-tag points at the pnpm version already running and that version is younger than `minimumReleaseAge`. The maturity cutoff moved the tag back to the previous mature release, so `pnpm self-update next-12` on v12.0.0-rc.4 switched to v12.0.0-rc.3.
