A `scope` set in a project's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` is now ignored, with a warning naming where to set it instead. `pnpm login` records the scope as a `@scope:registry` route in the machine-global `auth.ini`, which outranks `~/.npmrc` in every project — so a repository-committed file could redirect a scope such as `@acme` for all of a user's other projects after one routine login. Use `--scope`, the `PNPM_CONFIG_SCOPE` environment variable, or the global config file instead [#13557](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/13557).
