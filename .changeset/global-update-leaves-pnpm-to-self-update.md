`pnpm update -g` no longer downgrades a global package. `--latest` resolves the `latest` dist-tag, which can point at an older release than the one installed — after `pnpm add -g <pkg>@next`, for instance [#14270](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/14270).

`pnpm update -g` also no longer changes the pnpm version. pnpm's own global install belongs to `pnpm self-update` [#14270](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/14270).
