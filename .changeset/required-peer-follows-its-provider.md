When a dependency moves an exact dependency of its own to an older version, a peer dependency that pnpm installed automatically now moves with it. Before, `pnpm install` and `pnpm dedupe` kept the newer locked version of the peer, so the lockfile held two copies of it, for example two copies of `vue` [pnpm/tasks#61](https://github.com/pnpm/tasks/issues/61).
