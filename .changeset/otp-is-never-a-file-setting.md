`otp` is no longer read from any config file. Pass `--otp` on the command line, or set `PNPM_CONFIG_OTP`. A `pnpm-workspace.yaml` or a global `config.yaml` that carries `otp` is ignored, with a warning naming those two channels. `pnpm config set otp` fails with `ERR_PNPM_CONFIG_SET_NOT_A_FILE_SETTING` instead of writing an entry no loader reads back.

This closes a way to leak a secret. A repository could write `otp: ${NPM_TOKEN}` beside its own `registry:`, and `pnpm publish` sent that environment variable to the registry the same file named, in the `npm-otp` header of its first request [#13542](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/13542).
