`pnpm dlx` (and `pnpx`/`pnx`/`pnpm create`) now runs the same interactive `approve-builds` prompt as `pnpm add -g` when the package being launched depends on transitive packages with install scripts. Previously, the v11 `strictDepBuilds` default made dlx fail with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` and required users to re-run with `--allow-build=<pkg>` for every offending dependency. dlx also now removes the partially-populated cache directory when the install fails, so a subsequent run starts clean instead of reusing a broken install whose builds were silently skipped [#11444](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/11444).
