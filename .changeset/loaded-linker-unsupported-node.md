With `nodeLinker.type` set to `loaded`, Node.js now stops with `ERR_PNPM_LOADER_UNSUPPORTED_NODE` when it preloads the store loader on a version the loader cannot serve. The supported versions are `^24.18.0 || >=26.2.0`. On other versions, CommonJS packages imported from ESM failed with `Cannot find module` on their first relative `require()`.
