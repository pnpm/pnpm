Removing a dependency, or moving one to another already-locked version, no longer re-resolves the whole dependency graph just because some package resolves a peer with the same name. The lockfile update now compares the peer suffixes against the exact `name@version` the removal severed, so a suffix that names a different — still present — version of that dependency is left alone [#13781](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/13781).
