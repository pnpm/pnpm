`pnpm self-update` now keeps `package.json`'s `packageManager` and `devEngines.packageManager` in sync. When the legacy `packageManager` field pins pnpm, both fields are rewritten to the new exact pnpm version on update — `packageManager` to `pnpm@<version>` (without an integrity hash), and `devEngines.packageManager.version` to the same exact `<version>` (dropping any range operator). When only `devEngines.packageManager` is declared, the existing range-preserving behavior is unchanged [#11388](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/11388).
