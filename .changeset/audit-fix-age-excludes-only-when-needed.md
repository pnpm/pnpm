`pnpm audit --fix` and `pnpm audit --fix update` no longer add `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` entries for patched versions that were published before the `minimumReleaseAge` cutoff. The publish time of each minimum patched version is now checked against the registry metadata, and only versions young enough to be blocked by the age gate get an exclusion entry [#11563](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/11563).
