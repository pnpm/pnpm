`pnpm setup` now succeeds when it cannot tell which shell configuration file to update, for example in a container where `SHELL` is not set. It installs pnpm and prints the `PNPM_HOME` and `PATH` lines to add yourself. Previously it failed with `ERR_PNPM_UNKNOWN_SHELL`, and so did the installer script at get.pnpm.io [#16973](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/16973).
