`pnpm deploy` injects workspace dependencies again, so the deploy directory is self-contained instead of symlinking back into the source workspace [#13754](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/13754). Enabling `injectWorkspacePackages` with `dedupeInjectedDeps` disabled now also rewrites already-linked workspace dependencies to injected copies.
