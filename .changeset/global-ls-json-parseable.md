Fix `pnpm -g ls --json` and `pnpm -g ls --parseable` so they emit valid JSON and parseable output respectively, matching pnpm 10 behavior. Since the isolated global packages refactor in pnpm 11, the global list command had a custom path that always printed plain text and ignored `--json`/`--parseable`, which broke tools like `npm-check-updates` that parse the JSON output [#11440](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/11440).
