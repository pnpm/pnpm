# @pnpm/fetcher-base

## 9.0.0

### Major Changes

- 0a6544043: `generatingIntegrity` replaced with `writeResult`. When files are added to the store, the store returns not only the file's integrity as a result, but also the exact time when the file's content was verified with its integrity.

- f516d266c: Executables are saved into a separate directory inside the content-addressable storage.
- 42e6490d1: When a new package is being added to the store, its manifest is streamed in the memory. So instead of reading the manifest from the filesystem, we can parse the stream from the memory.
