Fast, disk space efficient package manager:

* **Fast.** Up to 2x faster than the alternatives (see [benchmark](#benchmark)).
* **Efficient.** Files inside `node_modules` are linked from a single content-addressable storage.
* **[Great for monorepos](https://pnpm.js.org/en/workspaces).**
* **Strict.** A package can access only dependencies that are specified in its `package.json`.
* **Deterministic.** Has a lockfile called `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
* **Works everywhere.** Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.
* **Battle-tested.** Used in production by teams of [all sizes](https://pnpm.js.org/en/users.html) since 2016.
  
To quote the [Rush](https://rushjs.io/) team:

> Microsoft uses pnpm in Rush repos with hundreds of projects and hundreds of PRs per day, and we‚Äôve found it to be very fast and reliable.

## Background

pnpm uses a content-addressable filesystem to store all files from all module directories on a disk.
When using npm or Yarn, if you have 100 projects using lodash, you will have 100 copies of lodash on disk.
With pnpm, lodash will be stored in a content-addressable storage, so:

1. If you depend on different versions of lodash, only the files that differ are added to the store.
  If lodash has 100 files, and a new version has a change only in one of those files,
  `pnpm update` will only add 1 new file to the storage.
1. All the files are saved in a single place on the disk. When packages are installed, their files are hard-linked
  from that single place consuming no additional disk space.

As a result, you save gigabytes of space on your disk and you have a lot faster installations!
If you'd like more details about the unique `node_modules` structure that pnpm creates and
why it works fine with the Node.js ecosystem, read this small article: [Flat node_modules is not the only way](https://pnpm.js.org/blog/2020/05/27/flat-node-modules-is-not-the-only-way).

## Installation

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

For other installation options [visit our website](https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation).

## Usage

Just use pnpm in place of npm/Yarn. E.g., install dependencies via:

```
pnpm install
```

Also, pnpx instead of npx:

```
pnpx create-react-app my-cool-new-app
```

For more advanced usage, read [pnpm CLI](https://pnpm.js.org/en/pnpm-cli) on our website, or run `pnpm help`.

## Benchmark

pnpm is up to 2x faster than npm and Yarn classic. See all benchmarks [here](https://github.com/pnpm/benchmarks-of-javascript-package-managers).
