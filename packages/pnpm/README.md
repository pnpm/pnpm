Features:

* **Fast.** As fast as npm and Yarn.
* **Efficient.** Files inside `node_modules` are linked from a single content-addressable storage.
* **[Great for monorepos](https://pnpm.js.org/en/workspaces).**
* **Strict.** A package can access only dependencies that are specified in its `package.json`.
* **Deterministic.** Has a lockfile called `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
* **Works everywhere.** Works on Windows, Linux, and OS X.

## Background

pnpm uses a content-addressable filesystem to store all files from all module directories on a disk.
When using npm or Yarn, if you have 100 projects using lodash, you will have 100 copies of lodash on disk.
With pnpm, lodash will be stored in a content-addressable storage, so:

1. If you depend on different versions of lodash, only the files that differ are added to the store.
  If lodash has 100 files, and a new version has a change only in one of those files,
  `pnpm update` will only add 1 new file to the storage.
1. All the files are saved in a single place on the disk. When packages are installed, their files are hard-linked
  from that single place consuming no additional disk space.

As a result, you save gigabytes of space on your disk and you have a lot faster installations!
If you'd like more details about the unique `node_modules` structure that pnpm creates and
why it works fine with the Node.js ecosystem, read this small article: [Flat node_modules is not the only way](https://medium.com/pnpm/flat-node-modules-is-not-the-only-way-d2e40f7296a3).

## Install

Using a [standalone script](https://github.com/pnpm/self-installer#readme):

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pnpm/self-installer/master/install.js | node
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pnpm/self-installer/master/install.js').Content | node
```


Via npx:

```
npx pnpm add -g pnpm
```

Once you first installed pnpm, you can upgrade it using pnpm:

```
pnpm add -g pnpm
```

> Do you wanna use pnpm on CI servers? See: [Continuous Integration](https://pnpm.js.org/en/continuous-integration).

## Usage

### pnpm CLI

Just use pnpm in place of npm. For instance, to install run:

```
pnpm install
```

For more advanced usage, read [pnpm CLI](https://pnpm.js.org/en/pnpm-cli) on our website.

For using the programmatic API, use pnpm's engine: [supi](packages/supi).

### pnpx CLI

npm has a great package runner called [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b).
pnpm offers the same tool via the `pnpx` command. The only difference is that `pnpx` uses pnpm for installing packages.

The following command installs a temporary create-react-app and calls it,
without polluting global installs or requiring more than one step!

```
pnpx create-react-app my-cool-new-app
```
