    case 'store':

        pnpm store status

        Returns a 0 exit code if packages in the store are not modified, i.e. the content of the package is the
        same as it was at the time of unpacking.

        pnpm store add [pkg...]

        Adds new packages to the store. E.g.: pnpm store add express@4 typescript@2

        pnpm store prune

        Removes unreferenced (extraneous, orphan) packages from the store. Unreferenced packages are packages that are not used by
        any projects on the system. Packages can become unreferenced after most installation operations. For instance, package
        foo@1.0.0 is updated to foo@1.0.1. If package foo@1.0.0 is not used by any other project on the system, it becomes unreferenced.

        It is good to keep unreferenced packages in the store for a while because frequently unreferenced packages are again needed
        very soon. For instance, after changing branch on a project and installing from an older shrinkwrap file.

        Pruning the store makes no harm. It only makes installation a bit slower in case the unreferenced files will be needed again.

      `

    case 'server':
      return stripIndent`
        pnpm server start

        Starts a service that does all interactions with the store.

          --protocol <auto|tcp|ipc>      the communication protocol used by the server

          --network-concurrency <number> maximum number of concurrent network requests
          --[no-]verify-store-integrity  if false, doesn't check whether packages in the store were mutated
          --[no-]lock
          --ignore-stop-requests         disallows stopping the server using \`pnpm server stop\`
          --ignore-upload-requests       disallows creating new side effect cache during install

        pnpm recursive [command] [flags]
        pnpm multi [command] [flags]
        pnpm m [command] [flags]

        Concurrently performs some actions in all subdirectories with a \`package.json\` (excluding node_modules).
        A \`pnpm-workspace.yaml\` file may be used to control what directories are searched for packages.

        Commands:

          install
          update
          uninstall [<@scope>/]<pkg>...    uninstall a dependency from each package
          link                             runs installation in each package. If a package is available locally, the local version is linked.
          unlink                           removes links to local packages and reinstalls them from the registry.
          list [[<@scope>/]<pkg>...]      list dependencies in each package.
          outdated [[<@scope>/]<pkg>...]  check for outdated dependencies in every package.

          run <command> [-- <args>...]     this runs an arbitrary command from each package's "scripts" object.
                                           If a package doesn't have the command, it is skipped.
                                           If none of the packages have the command, the command fails.

          test [-- <args>...]              this runs each package's "test" script, if one was provided.

          rebuild [[<@scope>/<name>]...]   this command runs the "npm build" command on each package.
                                           This is useful when you install a new version of node,
                                           and must recompile all your C++ addons with the new binary.

          exec -- <command> [args...]      run a command in each package.

        Options:

          --scope    restricts the scope to package names matching the given glob.
          --no-bail  continues executing other tasks even if a task threw an error.
