# pnpm

## 6.0.0-beta.0

### Major Changes

- Node.js v10 support is dropped. At least Node.js v12.17 is required for the package to work.

- The lockfile version is bumped to v5.3. Changes in the new format:
  - Blank lines added between package/project entries to improve readability and decrease merge issues.
  - The `resolution`, `engines`, `os`, and `cpu` fields are now always written in a single lines, as the first keys of the package objects.
  - A new field is added to the package objects: `transitivePeerDependencies`.

- The layout of the virtual store directory has changed (`node_modules/.pnpm`) to allow keeping cache in it:
  - All packages inside the virtual store directory are on the same depth. Instead of subdirectories, one directory is used with `#` instead of slashes.
  - New setting added: `modules-cache-max-age`. The default value of the setting is 10080 (7 days in seconds). `modules-cache-max-age` is the time in minutes after which pnpm should remove the orphan packages from `node_modules`.

- pnpx does not automatically install packages. A prompt asks the user if a package should be installed, if it is not present.

  `pnpx --yes` tells pnpx to install any missing package.

  `pnpx --no` makes pnpx fail if the called packages is not installed.

- Arbitrary pre/post hooks for user-defined scripts (such as `prestart`) are not executed automatically.

- `pnpmfile.js` renamed to `.pnpmfile.cjs` in order to force CommonJS.

- `.pnp.js` renamed to `.pnp.cjs` in order to force CommonJS.

- The `pnpm-prefix` setting is removed. Use `global-dir` to specify a custom location for the globally installed packages.

- The default depth of an update is `Infinity`, not `0`.

- The `--global` option should be used when linking from/to the global modules directory.

  Linking a package to the global directory:

  - pnpm v4: `pnpm link`
  - pnpm v5: `pnpm link --global`

  Linking a package from the global directory:

  - pnpm v4: `pnpm link foo`
  - pnpm v5: `pnpm link --global foo`

- pnpm's command file's extension changed to `.cjs` (`bin/pnpm.js`=>`bin/pnpm.cjs`).

### Minor Changes

- A new command added: [pnpm fetch](https://pnpm.io/cli/fetch).

  Fetch packages from a lockfile into virtual store, package manifest is ignored.
  This command is specifically designed to boost building a docker image.

## 5.18.9

### Patch Changes

- `pnpm store status` should look for the `integrity.json` file at the right place ([#2597](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2597)).
- Allow `--https-proxy`, `--proxy`, and `--noproxy` CLI options with the `install`, `add`, `update` commands ([#3274](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3274)).

## 5.18.8

### Patch Changes

- Installation of packages that have bin directories with subdirectories should not fail ([#3263](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3263)).
- The value of the `noproxy` setting should be read ([#3258](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3258)).
- An empty `node_modules` directory should not be created just to save a `.pnpm-debug.log` file to it.

## 5.18.7

### Patch Changes

- Proxying through `socks://` should work ([#3241](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3241)).
- Non-directories should not be added to `NODE_PATH` in command shims ([#3156](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3156)).

## 5.18.6

### Patch Changes

- Escape invalid charachters in file names, when linking packages from the store ([#3232](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/3232)).
- Link to the compatibility page fixed.

## 5.18.5

### Patch Changes

- Verify the name and version of the package before linking it from the store ([PR #3224](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/3224), [issue #3188](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3188)).
- The lockfile should be autofixed if it contains broken integrity checksums ([PR #3228](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/3228), [issue #3137](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3137)).

## 5.18.4

### Patch Changes

- Links to docs updated. The docs now lead to the versioned `5.x` docs, not the current ones.
- The command prompts should work when selecting shell target in `pnpm install-completion` [#3221](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3221).

## 5.18.3

### Patch Changes

- Broken lockfiles are ignore unless `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` is used [#1395](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/1395).
- Fixed occasional "Too many open file" error on `pnpm store status` [#3185](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3185).

## 5.18.2

### Patch Changes

- `pnpm audit` should work with the `--no-optional`, `--dev`, and `--prod` options [#3152](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3152).

## 5.18.1

### Patch Changes

- The ID of a tarball dependency should not contain colons, when the URL has a port. The colon should be escaped with a plus sign[#3182](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3182).

## 5.18.0

### Minor Changes

- `pnpm publish -r --force` should try to publish packages even if their current version is already in the registry.

## 5.17.3

### Patch Changes

- Turn off warnings about settings.
- The `-P/-D` shorthand options should work with the `pnpm why` command.
- `pnpm add --global pnpm` does not create PowerShell command shims for the pnpm CLI.

## 5.17.2

### Patch Changes

- Only display unknown settings warning, when `pnpm install` is executed [#3130](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/3130).
- Update help for the filter option. Some of the filtering patterns should be escaped in Zsh.
- Audit output should always have a new line at the end [#3134](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/3134).
- Return the correct registry for an aliased scoped dependency [#3103](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/3134).

## 5.17.1

### Minor Changes

- New '--reverse' CLI option added for reversing the order of package executions during `pnpm -r run` [#2985](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2985).

## 5.16.1

### Patch Changes

- Remove redundant empty lines when run `pnpm why --parseable` [#3101](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/3101).
- `pnpm publish --publish-branch=<branch>` does not fail [#2996](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2996).
- Don't print warnings when `.npmrc` contains empty lines with whitespaces [#3105](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/3105).

## 5.16.0

### Minor Changes

- Allow to ignore the builds of specific dependencies [#3080](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/3080).

  The list of dependencies that should never be built, is specified through the `pnpm.neverBuiltDependencies` of `package.json`. For instance:

  ```json
  {
    "pnpm": {
      "neverBuiltDependencies": ["fsevents", "level"]
    }
  }
  ```

- Print warnings if unknown settings are found in `.npmrc` [#3074](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/3074).

- pnpm can now be executed using its single bundled CLI file [#3096](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/3096).

- When pnpm crashes because the Node.js version is unsupported, the error message will now contain a link to the compatibility page of the pnpm documentation website.

- `pnpm pubish -r` prints an info message if there are no pending packages to be published.

## 5.15.3

### Patch Changes

- A failing optional dependency should not cause a crash of headless installation [#3090](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3090).
- `npx pnpm install --global pnpm` should not install pnpm to the temporary directory of npx [#2873](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2873).

## 5.15.2

### Patch Changes

- The lockfile's content should not "flicker" if some dependency's version is specified with build metadata [#2928](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2928).
- If `pnpm.overrides` were modified, the resolution stage may never be skipped [#3079](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/3079).
- The `pnpm` section of options is not included in the published version of a `package.json` [#3081](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/3081).
- Fix the error message that happens when trying to add a new dependency to the root of a workspace [#3082](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/3082).

## 5.15.1

### Patch Changes

- Finding the global directory location should not fail when one of the possible locations is in a read-only filesystem [#2794](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2794).

- Don't ask for confirmation, when publishing happens on a branch name `"main"` [#2995](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2995).

- Highlight the project names in the output of the `pnpm list` command [#3024](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3024).

- It should be possible to use the workspace protocol with version specs inside `pnpm.overrides` [#3029](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3029).

  For instance:

  ```json
  {
    "pnpm": {
      "overrides": {
        "foo": "workspace:*"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## 5.15.0

### Minor Changes

- Allow to specify the shell target when configuring autocompletion with `pnpm install-completion`. For instance: `pnpm install-completion zsh`.
- New option added: `enable-modules-dir`. When `false`, pnpm will not write any files to the modules directory (node_modules). This is useful for when the modules directory is mounted with filesystem in userspace (FUSE). There is an experimental CLI that allows to mount a modules directory with FUSE: [@pnpm/mount-modules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pnpm/mount-modules).

### Patch Changes

- Fixed a performance regression that was caused by [#3032](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/3032) and shipped in pnpm v5.13.7

  The performance of repeat `pnpm install` execution was in some cases significantly slower.

- Don't create broken symlinks to skipped optional dependencies, when hoisting. This issue was already fixed in pnpm v5.13.7 for the case when the lockfile is up-to-date. This fixes the same issue for cases when the lockfile needs updates. For instance, when adding a new package.

## 5.14.3

### Patch Changes

- Fixed an issue with installing peer dependencies. In some rare cases, when installing a new peer dependency, the other existing dependencies were removed [#3057](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/3057)

## 5.14.2

### Patch Changes

- Linking dependencies by absolute path should work. For instance: `pnpm link C:\src\foo` [#3025](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3025)

## 5.14.1

### Minor Changes

- New option added: `test-pattern`. `test-pattern` allows to detect whether the modified files are related to tests. If they are, the dependent packages of such modified packages are not included.

  This option is useful with the "changed since" filter. For instance, the next command will run tests in all changed packages, and if the changes are in source code of the package, tests will run in the dependent packages as well:

  ```
  pnpm --filter=...[origin/master] --test-pattern=test/* test
  ```

- An exception is thrown if the workspace manifest is created with the wrong extension: `pnpm-workspace.yml` instead of `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

### Patch Changes

- `--no-bail` should work with non-recursive commands [#3036](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3036).

## 5.13.7

### Patch Changes

- Broken symlinks are not created to skipped optional dependencies, when hoisting.

## 5.13.6

### Patch Changes

- Regression in `pnpm install-completion` fixed.
- Throw a meaningful error on malformed registry metadata.

## 5.13.5

### Patch Changes

- Include dependencies of dependents, when using `--filter ...pkg...` [#2917](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2917).
- Fix hanging requests issue. The number of max open sockets increased [#2998](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/2998).

## 5.13.4

### Patch Changes

- Issue with Homebrew fixed [#2993]https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2993).

## 5.13.3

- Fix regression with node-gyp that was introduced in v5.13.2 [#2988](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2988).

## 5.13.2

### Patch Changes

- The pnpm CLI is bundled for faster startup.

## 5.13.1

### Patch Changes

- pnpm should not leave empty temporary directories in the root of the partition [#2749](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2749).

## 5.13.0

### Minor Changes

- New setting added: `prefer-workspace-packages` [#2136](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2136).

  When `prefer-workspace-packages` is set to `true`, local packages from the workspace are preferred over
  packages from the registry, even if there is a newer version of that package in the registry.

  This setting is only useful if the workspace doesn't use `save-workspace-protocol=true`.

## 5.11.2

### Minor Changes

- Workspace packages now can be referenced through aliases [#2970](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2970).

  For instance, the package in the workspace may be named `foo`. Usually, you would reference it as `{ "foo": "workspace:*" }`.
  If you want to use a different alias, the next syntax will work now: `{ "bar": "workspace:foo@*" }`.

  Before publish, aliases are converted to regular aliased dependencies. The above example will become: `{ "bar": "npm:foo@1.0.0" }`.

- Workspace packages now can be referenced through relative path [#2959](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2959).

  For example, in a workspace with 2 packages:

  ```
  + packages
    + foo
    + bar
  ```

  `bar` may have `foo` in its dependencies declared as `{ "foo": "workspace:../foo" }`. Before publish, these specs are converted to regular version specs supported by all package managers.

- For better compatibility with prettier, two new default patterns added to `public-hoist-pattern`:
  - `@prettier/plugin-*`
  - `*prettier-plugin-*`

## 5.11.1

### Patch Changes

- Retry metadata download if the received JSON is broken [#2949](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2949).

## 5.11.0

### Minor Changes

- Conflicts in `pnpm-lock.yaml` are automatically fixed by `pnpm install` [#2965](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/2965).

## 5.10.4

### Patch Changes

- Don't ignore the `overrides` field of the root project, when the scope of the command doesn't include the root project.

## 5.10.2

### Patch Changes

- When extracting packages to the store, file duplicates are skipped.
- When creating a hard link fails, fall back to copying only if the target file does not exist.

## 5.10.1

### Minor Changes

- A `"pnpm"."overrides"` field may be used to override version ranges of dependencies.
  The overrides field can be specified only in the root project's `package.json`.

  An example of the `"pnpm"."overrides"` field:

  ```json
  {
    "pnpm": {
      "overrides": {
        "foo": "^1.0.0",
        "bar@^2.1.0": "3.0.0",
        "qar@1>zoo": "2"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  You may specify the package to which the overriden dependency belongs by separating the package selector from the dependency selector with a ">", for example `qar@1>zoo` will only override the `zoo` dependency of any `qar@1` dependency.

- A new setting added for specifying the shell to use, when running scripts: script-shell [#2942](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2942)

- When some of the dependencies of a package have the package as a peer depenendency, don't make the dependency a peer depenendency of itself.

- Lockfile version bumped to 5.2

## 5.9.3

### Patch Changes

- Fixes a regression with CLI commands inside a workspace introduced in v5.9.0 [#2925](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2925)

## 5.9.2

### Patch Changes

- Fixed multiple issues with inconsistent lockfile generation [#2919](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2919)

## 5.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Plug'n'Play support added [#2902](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2902)

  To use Plug'n'Play in a project, create a `.npmrc` file in its root with the following content:

  ```ini
  node-linker=pnp

  ; Setting symlink to false is optional.
  symlink=false
  ```

  All the commands will work, when executed through `pnpm run`.
  However, directly executing a `.js` file with Node.js will fail. Node's
  resolver should be patched with `.pnp.js`. So instead of `node index.js`, you should
  run: `node --require=./.pnp.js index.js`

- New setting: `symlink` [#2900](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/2900)

  When `symlink` is set to `false`, pnpm creates a virtual store directory (`node_modules/.pnpm`) without any symlinks.

### Patch Changes

- Fixed some edge cases with resolving peer dependencies [#2919](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2919).
- Installation should fail if there are references to a project that has been removed from the workspace [#2905](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/2905).
- pnpm should not suggest to update pnpm to a newer version, when the installed version is bigger than latest.

## 5.8.0

### Minor Changes

- New setting: `shell-emulator` [#2621](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2621)

  When `shell-emulator` is `true`, pnpm will use a shell emulator to execute scripts. So things like `FOO=1 pnpm run foo` and other simple bash syntax will work on Windows.

  pnpm uses the shell emulator that was developed for Yarn v2: [@yarnpkg/shell](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yarnpkg/shell).

- Exluding projects using `--filter=!<selector>` [#2804](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2804)

  Packages may be excluded from a command's scope, using "!" at the beginning of the selector.

  For instance, this will run tests in all projects except `foo`:

  ```
  pnpm --filter=!foo test
  ```

  And this one will run tests in all projects that are not under the `lib` directory:

  ```
  pnpm --filter=!./lib test
  ```

### Patch Changes

- When searching for a global bin directory, also look for symlinked commands [#2888](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2888).
- Don’t remove non‑pnpm `.dot_files` from `node_modules` [#2833](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/2833).
- During publish, check the active branch name after checking if the branch is clean.
- The `INIT_CWD` env variable is always set to the lockfile directory for scripts of dependencies [#2897](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/2897).
- When a package is both a dev dependency and a prod dependency, the package should be linked when installing prod dependencies only. This was an issue only when a lockfile was not present during installation [#2882](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2882).

## 5.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Performance improvements:
  - If a file in the store was never modified, we are not checking its integrity ([#2876](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/2876)).
  - All directories in the virtual store are created before symlinking and importing packages starts ([#2875](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/2875)).

## 5.6.1

### Patch Changes

- Fixing a regression introduced in v5.5.13. Installation should never fail during automatic importing method selection (#2869).

## 5.6.0

### Minor Changes

- `--workspace-root`, `-w`: a new option that allows to focus on the root workspace project.

  E.g., the following command runs the `lint` script of the root `package.json` from anywhere in the monorepo:

  ```
  pnpm -w lint
  ```

  PR #2866

- The progress indicator also shows the number of dependencies that are being added to the modules direcotory (#2832).

- Don't report scope, when only one workspace package is selected (#2855).

- If a script is not found in the current project but is present in the root project of the workspace, notify the user about it in the hint of the error (#2859).

- Publicly hoist anything that has "types" in the name. Packages like `@babel/types` are publicly hoisted by default (#2865).

### Patch Changes

- When no matching version is found, report the actually specified version spec in the error message (not the normalized one) (#1314).

## 5.5.13

### Patch Changes

- When `package-import-method` is set to `auto`, cloning is only tried once. If it fails, it is not retried for other packages.
- More information added to the Git check errors and prompt.
- Report an info log instead of a warning when some binaries cannot be linked.

## 5.5.12

### Patch Changes

- In some rare cases, `pnpm install --no-prefer-frozen-lockfile` didn't link the direct dependencies to the root `node_modules`. This was happening when the direct dependency was also resolving some peer dependencies.

## 5.5.11

### Patch Changes

- Sometimes, when installing new dependencies that rely on many peer dependencies, or when running installation on a huge monorepo, there will be hundreds or thousands of warnings. Printing many messages to the terminal is expensive and reduces speed, so pnpm will only print a few warnings and report the total number of the unprinted warnings.
- `pnpm outdated --long` should print details about the outdated commands.

## 5.5.10

### Patch Changes

- Fixing a regression that was shipped with pnpm v5.5.6. Cyclic dependencies that have peer dependencies were not symlinked to the root of `node_modules`, when they were direct dependencies.

## 5.5.9

### Patch Changes

- Always try to resolve optional peer dependencies. Fixes a regression introduced in pnpm v5.5.8

## 5.5.8

### Patch Changes

- "Heap out of memory" error fixed, which happened on some huge projects with big amount of peer dependencies, since pnpm v3.4.0 (#2339).

## 5.5.7

### Patch Changes

- Ignore non-array bundle\[d]Dependencies fields. Fixes a regression caused by https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/commit/5322cf9b39f637536aa4775aa64dd4e9a4156d8a

## 5.5.6

### Patch Changes

- "Heap out of memory" error fixed, which happened on some huge projects with big amount of peer dependencies, since pnpm v3.4.0 (#2339).
- `pnpm add --global <pkg>` should not break the global package, when the `save` setting is set to `false` (#2261).
- `pnpm test|start|stop` should allow the same options as `pnpm run test|start|stop` (#2814).
- Improve the error message on 404 errors. Include authorization details (#2818).

## 5.5.5

### Patch Changes

- Generate a valid lockfile, when the same dependency is specified both in `devDependencies` and `optionalDependencies` (#2807).
- It should be possible to set the fetch related options through CLI options (#2810).
- Fix a regression introduced to `pnpm run --parallel <script>` in pnpm v5.5.4.

## 5.5.4

### Patch Changes

- Any ESLint related dependencies are publicly hoisted by default (#2799).
- `pnpm install -r` should recreate the modules directory
  if the hoisting patterns were updated in a local config file.
  The hoisting patterns are configured via the `hoist-pattern`
  and `public-hoist-pattern` settings (#2802).
- The same code should run when running some command inside a project directory,
  or when using `--filter` to select a specific workspace project (#2805).

  This fixes an issue that was happening when running `pnpm add pkg` inside a workspace.
  The issue was not reproducible when running `pnpm add pkg --filter project` (#2798).

## 5.5.3

### Patch Changes

- pnpm should not always suggest to reinstall the modules directory, when `public-hoist-pattern` is set to nothing (#2783).
- When searching for a suitable directory for the global executables, search for node, npm, pnpm files only, not directories (#2793).

## 5.5.2

### Patch Changes

- `pnpm publish -r` does not publish packages with the temporary `pnpm-temp` distribution tag (#2686).
- Print the authorization settings (with hidden private info), when an authorization error happens during fetch (#2774).

## 5.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Stop looking for project root not only when `package.json` or `node_modules` is found
  but also on `package.json5` and `package.yaml`.

## 5.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Allow unknown options that are prefixed with `config.`

  `pnpm install --foo` would fail with an unknown option error.

  `pnpm install --config.foo` will work fine, setting the `npm_config_foo` environment variable for child lifecycle events.

### Patch Changes

- Don't leave empty temp directories in home directory (#2749).
- Reunpack the contents of a modified tarball dependency (#2747).
- `pnpm list -r` should print the legend only once.
- Don't read the `.npmrc` file that is outside the workspace.
- Hoisting should work in a workspace that has no root project.

## 5.4.12

### Patch Changes

- Fixing regression of v5.4.5: the `pnpm update` command should update the direct dependencies of the project.

## 5.4.11

### Patch Changes

- Fixing regression of v5.4.10: a warning during `package.json` save.

## 5.4.10

### Patch Changes

- Don't add a trailing new line to `package.json` if no trailing new line was present in it (#2716).
- Installing a new dependency with a trailing `@` (#2737).
- Ignore files in the modules directory (#2730).

## 5.4.9

### Patch Changes

- Get the right package name of a package resolved from GitHub registry (#2734).
- Registry set in lockfile resolution should not be ignored (#2733).
- Workspace range prefix should be removed from `peerDependencies` before publish (#2467).
- Use the same versions of dependencies across the pnpm monorepo.
- Fix lockfile not updated when remove dependency in project with readPackage hook (#2726).

## 5.4.8

### Patch Changes

- `pnpm audit --audit-level high` should not error if the found vulnerabilities are low and/or moderate (#2721).
- When purging an incompatible modules directory, don't remove the actual directory, just the contents of it (#2720).

## 5.4.7

### Patch Changes

- `pnpm outdated` should exit with exit code 1, when there are outdated dependencies.
- `pnpm audit` should exit with exit code 1, when vulnerabilities are found.
- `pnpm install --prod --frozen-lockfile` should not fail if there are dev dependencies used as peer dependencies of prod dependencies (#2711).

## 5.4.6

### Patch Changes

- `pnpm root -g` should not fail if pnpm has no write access to the global bin directory (#2700).

## 5.4.5

### Patch Changes

- `pnpm update dep --depth Infinity` should only update `dep`.
- `pnpm publish -r --dry-run` should not publish anything to the registry.

## 5.4.4

### Patch Changes

- `pnpm root -g` should not fail if pnpm has no write access to the global bin directory (#2700).
- Suggest to use pnpm to update pnpm.

## 5.4.3

### Patch Changes

- Should not print colored output when `color` is set to `never`. This was an issue in commands that don't use `@pnpm/default-reporter`. Commands like `pnpm list`, `pnpm outdated`.
- Changes that are made by the `readPackage` hook are not saved to the `package.json` files of projects.
- Allow the `--registry` option with the `pnpm audit` command.
- Allow the `--save-workspace-protocol` option.
- Don't use inversed colors to highlight search results in `pnpm list`, `pnpm why`.

## 5.4.2

### Patch Changes

- `pnpm install` should work as `pnpm install --filter {.}...`, when `recursive-install` is `false`.
- On first install, print an info message about the package importing (hard linking, cloning, or copying) method
  and the location of the virtual store and the content-addressable store.

## 5.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Installation of private Git-hosted repositories via HTTPS using an auth token.

  ```text
  pnpm add git+https://{token}:x-oauth-basic@github.com/SOME_ORG/SOME_PRIVATE_REPO.git
  ```

- A new setting called `recursive-install` was added. When it is set to `false`, `pnpm install` will only install dependencies in current project, even when executed inside a monorepo.

  If `recursive-install` is `false`, you should explicitly run `pnpm install -r` in order to install all dependencies in all workspace projects.

- Projects that don't have a `"version"` field may be installed as dependencies of other projects in the workspace, using the `"workspace:0.0.0"` specifier.

  So if there's `foo` in the repository that has no version field, `bar` may have it as a dependency:

  ```json
  "dependencies": {
    "foo": "workspace:0.0.0"
  }
  ```

- By default, all ESLint plugin are hoisted to the root of `node_modules`.

  `eslint-plugin-*` added as one of the default patterns of `public-hoist-pattern`.

- Improved error message on workspace range resolution error.

  Now the path to the project is printed, where the error originated.

### Patch Changes

- `pnpm prune` should accept the `--no-optional` and `--no-dev` options.

## 5.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Any unknown command is assumed to be a script. So `pnpm foo` becomes `pnpm run foo`.

### Patch Changes

- Fix installation of packages via repository URL. E.g., `pnpm add https://github.com/foo/bar`.

## 5.2.9

### Patch Changes

- `run --silent <cmd>` should only print output of the command and nothing from pnpm (#2660).
- installing a new optional dependency that has an option dependency should not fail (#2663).

## 5.2.8

### Patch Changes

- Fixing some issues with finding the target directory for command files during global installation.

## 5.2.7

### Patch Changes

## 5.2.6

### Patch Changes

- Use the proxy settings not only during resolution but also when fetching tarballs.

## 5.2.5

### Patch Changes

- Fixing some regressions with global bin directory caused by v5.2.4.

## 5.2.4

### Patch Changes

- Find the proper directory for linking executables during global installation.
- Fix `pnpm list --long`. This was a regression in pnpm v5.0.0.

## 5.2.3

### Patch Changes

- Own implementation of the `pnpm bin` command added (previously it was passed through to `npm bin`).
- Read the correct PATH env variable on all systems, when running pnpx. One Windows the correct path name might be Path or other.
- Install the pnpm bin executable to the directory of the globally installed pnpm executable, when running `pnpm add -g pnpm`.
- `pnpm store prune` should not fail when the store has some foreign files.
- `pnpm unlink --global` should unlink bin files from the global executables directory.

## 5.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Don't remove skipped optional dependencies from the current lockfile on partial installation.

## 5.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Hoisting should not fail if some of the aliases cannot be hoisted due to issues with the lockfile.

## 5.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Added a new setting: `public-hoist-pattern`. This setting can be overwritten by `shamefully-hoist`. The default value of `public-hoist-pattern` is `types/*`.

  If `shamefully-hoist` is `true`, `public-hoist-pattern` is set to `*`.

  If `shamefully-hoist` is `false`, `public-hoist-pattern` is set to nothing.

  `public-hoist-pattern` example configuration (through a `.npmrc` file):

  ```
  public-hoist-pattern[]=@types/*
  public-hoist-pattern[]=@angular/*
  ```

- Don't request the full metadata of package when running `pnpm outdated` or `pnpm publish -r` (#2633)

## 5.1.8

### Patch Changes

- Don't fail when the installed package's manifest (`package.json`) starts with a byte order mark (BOM). This is a fix for a regression that appeared in v5.0.0 (#2629).

## 5.1.7

### Patch Changes

- When `link-workspace-packages` is `false`, filtering by dependencies/dependents should ignore any packages that are not specified via `workspace:` ranges (#2625).
- Print a "Did you mean" line under the unknown option error with any option that look similar to the typed one (#2603).

## 5.1.6

### Patch Changes

- It should be possible to install a tarball through a non-standard URL endpoint served via the registry domain.

  For instance, the configured registry is `https://registry.npm.taobao.org/`.
  It should be possible to run `pnpm add https://registry.npm.taobao.org/vue/download/vue-2.0.0.tgz`

## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- ffddf34a8: Add new global option called `--stream`. (#2595)

  When used, the output from child processes is streamed to the console immediately, prefixed with the originating package directory. This allows output from different packages to be interleaved.

- The `run` and `exec` commands may use the `--parallel` option.

  `--parallel` completely disregards concurrency and topological sorting,
  running a given script immediately in all matching packages
  with prefixed streaming output. This is the preferred flag
  for long-running processes such as watch run over many packages.

  For example: `pnpm run --parallel watch`

- Color the child output prefixes (#2598)

### Patch Changes

- A recursive run should not rerun the same package script which started the lifecycle event (#2528).
- Fixing a regression on Windows. Fall back to copying if linking fails (429c5a560b7a32b0261e471ece349ec136ab7f4d)

### Patch Changes

- 2f9c7ca85: Fix a regression introduced in pnpm v5.0.0.
  Create correct lockfile when the package tarball is hosted not under the registry domain.
- 160975d62: This fixes a regression introduced in pnpm v5.0.0. Direct local tarball dependencies should always be reanalized on install.

## 5.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 81b537003: The usage of deprecated options should not crash the CLI. When a deprecated option is used (like `pnpm install --no-lock`), just print a warning.
- 187615f87: Fix installation of git-hosted packages. This was a regression in v5.

## 5.0.0

  All the benchmarks are [here](https://github.com/pnpm/benchmarks-of-javascript-package-managers/tree/5328f0165628b0ee5e22a8a433357d65bee75d64).

- A content-addressable filesystem is used to store packages on the disk.

  pnpm v5 uses a content-addressable filesystem to store all files from all module directories on a disk. If you depend on different versions of lodash, only the files that differ are added to the store. If lodash has 100 files, and a new version has a change only in one of those files, pnpm update will only add 1 new file to the storage.

  For more info about the structure of this new store, you can check the [GitHub issue about it](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2470).

  This change was inspired by [dupe-krill](https://github.com/kornelski/dupe-krill) and the content-addressable storage of Git.

- Reduced directory nesting in the virtual store directory.

  In pnpm v4, if you installed `foo@1.0.0`, it was hard-linked into `node_modules/.pnpm/registry.npmjs.org/foo/1.0.0/`.

  In pnpm v5, it will be hard-linked into `node_modules/.pnpm/foo@1.0.0/`. This new structure of the virtual store directory drastically reduces the number of directories pnpm has to create. Hence, there are fewer filesystem operations, which improves speed.

- `pnpm store usages` removed.

  This command was using information from the `store.json` files, which is not present in the new content-addressable storage anymore.

- The `independent-leaves` setting has been removed.

  When hoisting was off, it was possible to set the `independent-leaves` setting to `true`. When `true`, leaf dependencies were symlinked directly from the global store. However, we turned hoisting on by default for pnpm v4, so this feature has no future at the moment.

- The `resolution-strategy` setting has been removed.

  By default, the `fewer-dependencies` resolution strategy is used. It was possible to select a `fast` resolution strategy. This setting is deprecated to simplify future improvements to the resolution algorithm.

- The store and the modules directory are not locked.

  We are not using directory locks anymore. So the `--no-lock` option will throw an error. Some users had [issues](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/594) with locking. We have confidence that pnpm will never leave either node_modules or the store in a broken state,
  so we removed locking.

- `git-checks` is `true` by default.

  By default, `pnpm publish` will make some checks before actually publishing a new version of your package.

  The next checks will happen:

  - The current branch is your publish branch. The publish branch is `master` by default. This is configurable through the `publish-branch` setting.
  - Your working directory is clean (there are no uncommitted changes).
  - The branch is up-to-date.

  If you don't want this checks, run `pnpm publish --no-git-checks` or set this setting to `false` via a `.npmrc` file.

- In case of a crash, the debug file will be written to `node_modules/.pnpm-debug.log` (not to `pnpm-debug.log` as in v4 and earlier).

### Minor Changes

- The `link-workspace-packages` setting may now be set to `deep`.

  When `link-workspace-packages` is set to `deep`, packages from the workspace will be linked even to subdependencies.
