- a5febb913: The importPackage function of the store controller is importing packages directly from the side-effects cache.
- a5febb913: The upload function of the store controller accepts `opts.filesIndexFile` instead of `opts.packageId`.

## 8.0.0-alpha.3

### Major Changes

- da091c71: Remove state from store. The store should not store the information about what projects on the computer use what dependencies. This information was needed for pruning in pnpm v4. Also, without this information, we cannot have the `pnpm store usages` command. So `pnpm store usages` is deprecated.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [da091c71]
  - @pnpm/types@6.0.0-alpha.0
  - @pnpm/resolver-base@7.0.1-alpha.0

## 8.0.0-alpha.2

### Minor Changes

- 42e6490d1: The fetch package to store function does not need the pkgName anymore.
