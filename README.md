## Background

pnpm uses hard links and symlinks to save one version of a module only ever once on a disk.
When using npm or Yarn for example, if you have 100 projects using the same version
of lodash, you will have 100 copies of lodash on disk. With pnpm, lodash will be saved in a
single place on the disk and a hard link will put it into the `node_modules` where it should
be installed.

As a result, you save gigabytes of space on your disk and you have a lot faster installations!
If you'd like more details about the unique `node_modules` structure that pnpm creates and
why it works fine with the Node.js ecosystem, read this small article: [Why should we use pnpm?](https://www.kochan.io/nodejs/why-should-we-use-pnpm.html)

## Install

Using a [standalone script](.scripts/self-installer):

```
curl -L https://unpkg.com/@pnpm/self-installer | node
```

Via npm:

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

Once you first installed pnpm, you can upgrade it using pnpm:

```
pnpm install -g pnpm
```

> Do you wanna use pnpm on CI servers? See: [Continuous Integration](docs/recipes/continuous-integration.md).

## Usage

### pnpm CLI

Just use pnpm in place of npm:

```
pnpm install lodash
```

npm commands that are re-implemented in pnpm:

* `install`
* `update`
* `uninstall`
* `link`
* `prune`
* `list`
* `install-test`
* `outdated`
* `rebuild`
* `root`
* `help`

Also, pnpm has some custom commands:

* `dislink`

  Unlinks a package. Like `yarn unlink` but pnpm re-installs the dependency
  after removing the external link.
* `store status`

  Returns a 0 exit code if packages in the store are not modified, i.e. the
  content of the package is the same as it was at the time of unpacking.
* `store prune`

  Removes unreferenced (extraneous, orphan) packages from the store.

The rest of the commands pass through to npm.

For using the programmatic API, use pnpm's engine: [supi](https://github.com/pnpm/supi).

### pnpx CLI

npm has a great package runner called [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b).
pnpm offers the same tool via the `pnpx` command. The only difference is that `pnpx` uses pnpm for installing packages.

The following command installs a temporary create-react-app and calls it,
without polluting global installs or requiring more than one step!

```
pnpx create-react-app my-cool-new-app
```

### Configuring

pnpm uses npm's programmatic API to read configs. Hence, you should set configs for pnpm the same way you would for npm.

Furthermore, pnpm uses the same configs that npm uses for doing installations. If you have a private registry and npm is configured
to work with it, pnpm should be able to authorize requests as well, with no additional configuration.

However, pnpm has some unique configs as well:

#### store

* Default: **~/.pnpm-store**
* Type: **path**

The location where all the packages are saved on the disk.

The store should be always on the same disk on which installation is happening. So there will be one store per disk.
If there is a home directory on the current disk, then the store is created in `<home dir>/.pnpm-store`. If there is no
homedir on the disk, then the store is created in the root. For example, if installation is happening on disk `D`
then the store will be created in `D:\.pnpm-store`.

It is possible to set a store from a different disk but in that case pnpm will copy, not link, packages from the store.
Hard links are possible only inside a filesystem.

#### offline

* Default: **false**
* Type: **Boolean**

If true, pnpm will use only packages already available in the store.
If a package won't be found locally, the installation will fail.

#### network-concurrency

* Default: **16**
* Type: **Number**

Controls the maximum number of HTTP requests that can be done simultaneously.

#### child-concurrency

* Default: **5**
* Type: **Number**

Controls the number of child processes run parallelly to build node modules.

#### lock

* Default: **true**
* Type: **Boolean**

Dangerous! If false, the store is not locked. It means that several installations using the same
store can run simultaneously.

Can be passed in via a CLI option. `--no-lock` to set it to false. E.g.: `pnpm install --no-lock`.

> If you experience issues similar to the ones described in [#594](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/594), use this option to disable locking.
> In the meanwhile, we'll try to find a solution that will make locking work for everyone.

#### independent-leaves

* Default: **false**
* Type: **Boolean**

If true, symlinks leaf dependencies directly from the global store. Leaf dependencies are
packages that have no dependencies of their own. Setting this config to `true` might break some packages
that rely on location but gives an average of **8% installation speed improvement**.

#### verify-store-integrity

* Default: **true**
* Type: **Boolean**

If false, doesn't check whether packages in the store were mutated.

#### ignore-files-level

* Default: **false**
* Type: **false|'safe'|'unsafe'**

**Experimental.** Ignores files that are not needed in production, when unpacking dependencies. Can noticeably improve speed
on packages with lots of dependencies (>1000).

The main difference between the `'safe'` and `'unsafe'` modes is that unsafe ignores the LICENSE files.
Ignoring license might be dangerous from legal point of view. Use it at your own risk.

### Hooks

pnpm allows to step directly into the installation process via special functions called *hooks*.
Hooks can be declared in a file called `pnpmfile.js`. `pnpmfile.js` should live in the root of the project.

An example of a `pnpmfile.js` that changes the dependencies field of a dependency:

```js
module.exports = {
  hooks: {
    readPackage
  }
}

// This hook will override the manifest of foo@1 after downloading it from the registry
// foo@1 will always be installed with the second version of bar
function readPackage (pkg) {
  if (pkg.name === 'foo' && pkg.version.startsWith('1.')) {
    pkg.dependencies = {
      bar: '^2.0.0'
    }
  }
  return pkg
}
```

### Aliases

Aliases let you install packages with custom names.

Lets' assume you use `lodash` all over your project. There is a bug in `lodash` that breaks your project.
You have a fix but `lodash` won't merge it. Normally you would either install `lodash` from your fork
directly (as a git-hosted dependency) or publish it with a different name. If you use the second solution
you have to replace all the requires in your project with the new dependency name (`require('lodash')` => `require('awesome-lodash')`)`.
With aliases, you have a third option.

Publish a new package called `awesome-lodash` and install it using `lodash` as its alias:

```
pnpm install lodash@npm:awesome-lodash
```

No changes in code are needed. All the requires of `lodash` will import `awesome-lodash`.

Sometimes you'll want to use two different versions of a package in your project. Easy:

```
pnpm install lodash1@npm:lodash@1
pnpm install lodash2@npm:lodash@2
```

Now you can require the first version of lodash via `require('lodash1')` and the second via `require('lodash2')`.

This gets even more powerful when combined with hooks. Maybe you want to replace `lodash` with `awesome-lodash`
in all the packages in `node_modules`. You can easily achieve that with the following `pnpmfile.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  hooks: {
    readPackage
  }
}

function readPackage (pkg) {
  if (pkg.dependencies && pkg.dependencies.lodash) {
    pkg.dependencies.lodash = 'npm:awesome-lodash@^1.0.0'
  }
  return pkg
}
```

## Benchmark

pnpm is faster than npm and Yarn. See [this](https://github.com/zkochan/node-package-manager-benchmark)
benchmark which compares the three package managers on different types of applications.

Here are the benchmarks on a React app:

![](https://cdn.rawgit.com/pnpm/node-package-manager-benchmark/7f0c3e40/results/imgs/react-app.svg)

## Limitations

1. `npm-shrinkwrap.json` and `package-lock.json` are ignored. Unlike pnpm, npm can install the
same `name@version` multiple times and with different sets of dependencies.
npm's shrinkwrap file is designed to reflect the `node_modules` layout created
by npm. pnpm cannot create a similar layout, so it cannot respect
npm's lockfile format.
2. You can't publish npm modules with `bundleDependencies` managed by pnpm.
3. Binstubs (files in `node_modules/.bin`) are always shell files not
symlinks to JS files. The shell files are created to help pluggable CLI apps
in finding their plugins in the unusual `node_modules` structure. This is very
rarely an issue and if you expect the file to be a js file, just reference the
original file instead, as described in [#736](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/736).
4. Node.js doesn't work with the [--preserve-symlinks](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_preserve_symlinks) flag when executed in a project that uses pnpm.

## Other Node.js package managers

* `npm`. The oldest and most widely used. See [pnpm vs npm](docs/pnpm-vs-npm.md).
* `ied`. Built on a very similar premise as pnpm. pnpm takes huge inspiration from it.
* `Yarn`. The first Node.js package manager that invented lockfiles and offline installations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does my `node_modules` folder use disk space if packages are stored in a global store?

pnpm creates [hard links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link) from the global store to project's `node_modules` folders.
Hard links point to the same place on the disk where the original files are.
So, for example, if you have `foo` in your project as a dependency and it occupies 1MB of space,
then it will look like it occupies 1MB of space in the project's `node_modules` folder and
the same amount of space in the global store. However, that 1MB is *the same space* on the disk
addressed from two different locations. So in total `foo` occupies 1MB,
not 2MB.

* [A thread from the pnpm chat room](https://gist.github.com/zkochan/106cfef49f8476b753a9cbbf9c65aff1)

### Does it work on Windows? It is harder to create symlinks on Windows

Using symlinks on Windows is problematic indeed. That is why pnpm uses junctions instead of symlinks on Windows OS.

### Does it work on Windows? Nested `node_modules` approach is basically incompatible with Windows

Early versions of npm had issues because of nesting all `node_modules` (see [Node's nested node_modules approach is basically incompatible with Windows](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/6960)). However, pnpm does not create deep folders, it stores all packages flatly and uses symlinks to create the dependency tree structure.

### What about circular symlinks?

Although pnpm uses symlinks to put dependencies into `node_modules` folders, circular symlinks are avoided because parent packages are placed into the same `node_modules` folder in which their dependencies are. So `foo`'s dependencies are not in `foo/node_modules` but `foo` is in `node_modules/foo`, together with its own dependencies.

### Why have hard links at all? Why not symlink directly to the global store?

One package can have different sets of dependencies on one machine.

In project **A** `foo@1.0.0` can have dependency resolved to `bar@1.0.0` but in project **B** the same dependency of `foo` might
resolve to `bar@1.1.0`. So pnpm hard links `foo@1.0.0` to every project where it is used, in order to create different sets
of dependencies for it.

Direct symlinking to the global store would work with Node's `--preserve-symlinks` flag. But `--preserve-symlinks` comes
with a bunch of different issues, so we decided to stick with hard links.
For more details about why this decision was made, see: https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps/issues/46.
