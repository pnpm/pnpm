# How peers are resolved

One of the very great features of pnpm is that in one project, a specific version of a package will always have
one set of dependencies. There is one exclusion from it though - packages with [peer dependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#peerdependencies).

Peer dependencies are resolved from dependencies installed higher in the dependency tree.
That means if `foo@1.0.0` has two peers (`bar@^1` and `baz@^1`) then it might have different sets of dependencies
in the same project.

```
- foo-parent-1
  - bar@1.0.0
  - baz@1.0.0
  - foo@1.0.0
- foo-parent-2
  - bar@1.0.0
  - baz@1.1.0
  - foo@1.0.0
```

In the example above, `foo@1.0.0` is installed for `foo-parent-1` and `foo-parent-2`. Both packages have `bar` and `baz` as well, but
they dependend on different versions of `baz`. As a result, `foo@1.0.0` has two different sets of dependencies: one with `baz@1.0.0`
and the other one with `baz@1.1.0`. In order to support these use cases, pnpm has to hard link `foo@1.0.0` as many times as many different
dependency sets it has.

Normally, if a package does not have peer dependencies, it is hard linked to a `node_modules` folder next to symlinks of its dependencies.

<pre>
- .registry.npmjs.org / foo / 1.0.0 / node_modules
  <sub>hard link to the specific foo package in the store</sub>
  - foo
  <sub>dependencies of foo, symlinks to folders where these deps are resolved with their deps</sub>
  - qux
  - plugh
</pre>

However, if `foo` has peer dependencies, there cannot be one single set of dependencies for it, so
we create different sets, for different peer dependency resolutions:

<pre>
- .registry.npmjs.org / foo / 1.0.0

  <sub>regular dependencies of foo</sub>
  - node_modules
    - qux
    - plugh

  - bar@1.0.0+baz@1.0.0 / node_modules
    <sub>hard link</sub>
    - foo
    <sub>symlinks to peer dependencies</sub>
    - bar <sub>v1.0.0</sub>
    - baz <sub>v1.0.0</sub>

  - bar@1.0.0+baz@1.1.0 / node_modules
    <sub>hard link</sub>
    - foo
    <sub>symlinks to peer dependencies</sub>
    - bar <sub>v1.0.0</sub>
    - baz <sub>v1.1.0</sub>
</pre>

We create symlinks either to the `foo` that is inside `bar@1.0.0+bar@1.0.0/node_modules` or to the one in `bar@1.0.0+bar@1.1.0/node_modules`.
As a consequence, the Node.js module resolver algorithm will find the correct peers.

*If the resolved peer is a direct dependency of the project*, it is not grouped separately with the dependent package.
This is done to make it easier to make predictable and fast named (`pnpm i foo`) and general (`pnpm i`) installations.
So if the project dependends on `bar@1.0.0`, the dependencies from our example will be grouped like this:

<pre>
- bar <sub>v1.0.0</sub>
- .registry.npmjs.org / foo / 1.0.0

  <sub>regular dependencies of foo</sub>
  - node_modules
    - qux
    - plugh

  - baz@1.0.0 / node_modules
    <sub>hard link</sub>
    - foo
    <sub>symlinks to peer dependencies</sub>
    - baz <sub>v1.0.0</sub>

  - baz@1.1.0 / node_modules
    <sub>hard link</sub>
    - foo
    <sub>symlinks to peer dependencies</sub>
    - baz <sub>v1.1.0</sub>
</pre>

*If a package has no peer dependencies but has dependencies with peers that are resolved higher in the tree*, then
that transitive package can appear in the project with different sets of dependencies. For instance, there's package `a@1.0.0`
with a single dependency `framework@1.0.0`. `framework@1.0.0` has a peer dependency `plugin@^1`. `a@1.0.0` will never resolve the
peers of `framework@1.0.0`, so it becomes dependent from the peers of `framework@1.0.0` as well.

Here's how it will look like in `node_modules/.registry.npmjs.org`, in case if `a@1.0.0` will need to appear twice in the project's
`node_modules`, once resolved with `plugin@1.0.0` and once with `plugin@1.1.0`.

<pre>
- .registry.npmjs.org
  - a / 1.0.0
    - plugin@1.0.0 / node_modules
      - a
      <sub>-> .registry.npmjs.org / framework / 1.0.0 / plugin@1.0.0 / node_modules / framework</sub>
      - framework <sub>v1.0.0 but dependent on plugin@1.0.0</sub>
    - plugin@1.1.0 / node_modules
      - a
      <sub>-> .registry.npmjs.org / framework / 1.0.0 / plugin@1.1.0 / node_modules / framework</sub>
      - framework <sub>v1.0.0 but dependent on plugin@1.1.0</sub>

  - framework / 1.0.0
    - plugin@1.0.0 / node_modules
      - framework
      - plugin <sub>v1.0.0</sub>
    - plugin@1.1.0 / node_modules
      - framework
      - plugin <sub>v1.1.0</sub>

  - plugin
    - 1.0.0 / node_modules / plugin
    - 1.1.0 / node_modules / plugin
</pre>
