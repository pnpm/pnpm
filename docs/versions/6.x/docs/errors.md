## ERR_PNPM_UNEXPECTED_STORE

A modules directory is present and is linked to a different store directory.

If you changed the store directory intentionally, run `pnpm install` and pnpm will reinstall the dependencies using the new store.

## ERR_PNPM_NO_MATCHING_VERSION_INSIDE_WORKSPACE

A project has a workspace dependency that does not exist in the workspace.

For instance, package `foo` has `bar@1.0.0` in the `dependencies`:

```json
{
  "name": "foo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "bar": "workspace:1.0.0"
  }
}
```

However, there is only `bar@2.0.0` in the workspace, so `pnpm install` will fail.

To fix this error, all dependencies that use the [workspace protocol] should be updated to use versions of packages that are present in the workspace. This can be done either manually or using the `pnpm -r update` command.

[workspace protocol]: ./workspaces.md#workspace-protocol-workspace
